## Lab Assignment 2: Building and Deploying a CRUD Application

### Overview
In this lab assignment, we will create a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application in a programming language of our choice. The application will feature core functionality that interacts with in-memory data structures. Additionally, we will integrate build automation tools, Docker, and set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the building, testing, and deployment processes.

### Application Description
The CRUD application will manage an employee database. It will allow users to perform the following operations:
- Create a new employee record.
- Read an existing employee record.
- Update an existing employee record.
- Delete an existing employee record.

### Features
- **Create Employee**: Users can add a new employee record by providing details such as ID, name, department, and position.
- **Read Employee**: Users can view details of an existing employee by providing their ID.
- **Update Employee**: Users can modify details of an existing employee, such as name, department, or position, by providing their ID.
- **Delete Employee**: Users can delete an existing employee record by providing their ID.

### Development Steps
1. **Develop the Application**: We will create the CRUD application in our chosen programming language, implementing core functionality to manage employee records.
2. **Integrate Build Automation Tools**: Configure a build automation tool to automate compiling, testing, and packaging processes. This ensures consistent and efficient development workflows.
3. **Implement Docker**: Develop a Dockerfile to containerize the application, ensuring it builds and runs within a Docker environment. This facilitates easy deployment and scalability.
4. **Set Up a CI/CD Pipeline**: Establish a CI/CD pipeline using platforms like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD. This pipeline will automate the building, testing, and deployment processes, enhancing development and deployment practices.

### Goal
By the end of this lab assignment, participants should be able to effectively use build automation tools, Docker, and CI/CD workflows to streamline development and deployment processes. They will gain practical experience in building, testing, and deploying applications using modern software development practices.
